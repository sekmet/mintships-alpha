## Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

git clone https://github.com/sekmet/mintships-eth-polygon-alpha my-project-name
cd my-project-name

## Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```

```

Now, your app is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.


### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
